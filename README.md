# Code Ace Jumper

This extensions provides you with easy Ace Jump feature for Visual Studio Code. Ace Jump is fast cursor movement without touching neither the mouse nor cursor keys.

## Commands

- `extension.aceJump` when a key is specified, Code Ace Jumper matches each word's initial letter in the document. Words are identified by their separators (whitespaces, dots, squares, etc) which can be easily configured. Each initial letter is then marked with a unique char: by hitting a key, the cursor will be instantly moved in the corresponding position.

- `extension.aceJump.multiChar` allows us to refine the placeholders by providing more characters. When one matches it automatically jumps, otherwise you can escape and then jump by matching remaining placeholders.

- `extension.aceJump.line` allows us to show placeholder for each visible line so we can jump directly to the line

- `extension.aceJump.selection` allows us to refine the placeholders by providing more characters. When one matches it automatically jumps, otherwise you can escape and then jump by matching remaining placeholders.

- `extension.aceJump.switchFinderMode` swich finder mode (char or regex).

## Keyboard shortcuts

You may set keyboard shortcuts for invoking Code Ace Jumper by entering values in the keybindings.json file. For example:

```json
{
    "key": "your key",
    "command": "extension.aceJump"
},
{
    "key": "your key",
    "command": "extension.aceJump.multiChar"
},
{
    "key": "your key",
    "command": "extension.aceJump.line"
},
{
    "key": "your key",
    "command": "extension.aceJump.selection"
},
{
    "key": "your key",
    "command": "extension.aceJump.switchFinderMode"
}
```

Alternatively, you can set shortcuts using Code's own keyboard shortcuts GUI.

## Advanced visual configuration for the placeholder

Code Ace Jumper is preset with sensible visual defaults. You can further configure the aesthetics of the placeholders shown by adjusting the following settings in your `settings.json` file:

```json
aceJump.placeholder.backgroundColor: placeholder background color; defaults to #c0b18b
aceJump.placeholder.color: placeholder width; defaults to #333
aceJump.placeholder.upperCase: placeholder font to uppercase; defaults to false
aceJump.placeholder.border: placeholder border; defaults to none
aceJump.placeholder.fontWeight: placeholder font weight; defaults to 500
```

## install

```shell
npm run package
code --install-extension codeacejumper-x.x.x.vsix
```

## Finder Mode (`aceJump.finder.mode`)

The following three commands allow you to select between `char` and `regex` finder modes:

- AceJump: Jump
- AceJump: MultiChar
- AceJump: Selection

In `char` mode, when a command is executed, the character entered are used to search for matching occurrences and set placeholders (jumpable positions).
On the other hand, in `regex` mode, a regular expression that corresponds to the character entered at the time of command execution is used to search for matching occurrences and set placeholders (jumpable positions).
The correspondence between character and regular expression can be obtained from the setting item: `aceJump.finder.charRegexMap`.

Furthermore, switching between `char` mode and `regex` mode is done using the `AceJump: Switch finder mode (char|regex)` command.

Also, if the setting item `disableOnlyInitialLetterInRegex` is set to `true`,
during `regex` mode, the value of `aceJump.finder.onlyInitialLetter` is forcibly changed to `false`, allowing placeholders (jumpable positions) to be set not only at the beginning of words but also elsewhere. When switching back to `char` mode, `aceJump.finder.onlyInitialLetter` is restored to its original value.

## Character to Regular Expression Mapping (`aceJump.finder.charRegexMap`)

The default value for the setting item `aceJump.finder.charRegexMap` is created based on regular expressions generated by [cmigemo](https://www.kaoriya.net/software/cmigemo/), using the tool located at [tools/make-regexmap](./tools/make-regexmap/).
